       <p>Hello my name is Steven . I'm currently a sophomore in college but after two years of jumping around between majors i discovered Programming is something that peaked my interest the most after pre-med and accounting , so here i am . I love to play tennis, reading , gaming , and traveling .</p> <p>My guility pleasure for the past acouple years been watching anime/korean drama , and reading chinese novels. Youtube , reddit, and wuxiaworld is the three things i visit the most daily , because youtube is just an essential , and anything from news to weird stories can be found on reddit , and without wuxiaworld , finding new novels to read would be hard . </p> <p> The one thing i cannot live without is black pepper , it can make anything taste better , without it , some food would just be bland . Its a pleasure to meet you all , and will be looking forward to meeting you in person.</p>
